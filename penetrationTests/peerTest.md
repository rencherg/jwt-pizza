The first screenshot shows an error message confirming the query was executed (since the error occurs after the query). The second screenshot shows the same result in the local database‚Äîboth passwords were overwritten. |

# üìò Combined Summary of Learnings

## Sam

In this assignment I learned the potential difficulty of exploiting another‚Äôs application if proper security measures have been taken. The low-hanging fruit attack would have been to try a SQL injection attack with input fields. Since they were parameterized/sanitized that made a SQL injection attack difficult. I also learned that vulnerabilities might not necessarily lead to an attack on your website but an attack on your users. For example, the registration payloads were left unencrypted and a competent man in the middle attack would compromise their passwords. Penetration testing on your own site as well as other sites can lead to vulnerability discovery that you wouldn‚Äôt have found before.

## Grant

I learned that when securing an application you need to be very careful that all vulnerabilities are covered. Hackers won‚Äôt leave any stone unturned when they attack your site. We found pages and endpoints that weren‚Äôt as secure as they should have been. While their access didn‚Äôt cause major security vulnerabilities, viewing them could give hints to hackers that they could use in other attack methods. I also learned that penetration testing is a valuable tool. This type of testing allows you to stand in the shows of the hacker and attack your site. This opened my eyes that there is a lot to learn about penetration testing and that it is very useful in building applications.
