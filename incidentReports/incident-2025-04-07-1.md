# Incident: 2025-04-07 ~14-30-00 UTC

## Summary

```md
Sometime between about 14:30 and 15:00UTC on April 7th, 2025, there was a major outage in the JWT Pizza Web Application. This outage affected all users attempting to order pizza, resulting in a significant loss of money and dip in JWT Pizza stock price The problem was caused by a malfunctioning API endpoint used to process JWT Pizza orders. The problem was fixed about 30 minutes after it was identified and business began to resume normally.
```

## Detection

```md
The incident was first detected when, the on-call developer rolled out of bed at 15:03UTC after sleeping through his alarm. The shock of knowing that an outage could have started hit him and his adrenaline levels spiked. He frantically opened his laptop and began looking at his Grafana Dashboard. Indeed something unfortunate had happened as pizza sales were at zero. He also noticed that any API request to the endpoint responsible for processing orders was giving a 500 error code.

We could improve our detection time by helping our developers get better sleep so that they won't sleep through their alarms. This incident also made it clear that there needs to be better error logging and detection through Grafana. 
```

## Impact

```md
For about 30-60 minutes ending at 15:37 UTC all customers could not order any JWT Pizza because of a malfunctioning order API. Many users complained about the isue on social media.
```

## Timeline

- _~14:30-15:00_ - /api/order API goes down, preventing any order from being completed.
- _15:03_ - The oncall engineer rolls out of bed when a wave of adrenaline hits him.
- _15:06_ - The engineer opens his Grafana dashboard and notices that orders are not being completed and error codes are being thrown.
- _15:07_ - The issue is escalated to top priority.
- _15:10_ - The engineer begins debugging.
- _15:19_ - The engineer notices that it is the /api/order API that isn't functioning correctly.
- _15:29_ - The engineer begins using Postman to make requests to the endpoint.
- _15:36_ - The issue is discovered and resolved through API requests.
- _15:39_ - The engineer confirms that the endpoint is functioning and the site returns to normal.
```

## Response

```md
The oncall engineer, Grant, came online at 15:06 UTC to resolve the issue. Grant notices the issue through the Grafana dashboard and used Postman to make API requests and solve the problem. Grant needed to remember how to use Postman but other than that the debugging went smoothly.
```

## Root cause

```md
A bug in the /api/orders endpoint brought down the endpoint. The emergency fix should have solved the issue.
```

## Resolution

```md
A mysterious link was discovered in failing /api/order responses. Clicking the link seemed to solve the issue.

To improve I would have improved my Grafana alerts because for whatever reason they were not triggered. This would have easily cut response time in half.
```

## Prevention

```md
I have seen cases similar to this where a typo or bug in the code will bring down an endpoint in a production environment. Good code quality and thorough review prevents this kind of thing.
```

## Action items

```md
1. Better code quality and review.
2. Better Grafana logging
```
